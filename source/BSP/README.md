# IDP-3500-04A Board Support Package

## Introduction
This repository offers hardware support for the IDP-3500-04A platform. This BSP can function independently with a test application. A USB console is provided for displaying debug information.

## Hardware Features
- FT903 32-bit RISC microcontroller (MCU) with 100MHz system clock
- FT811 graphics controller with display, touch and audio functionality
- 3.5-inch TFT LCD with capacitive touch
- Integrated buzzer for audio notifications
- Powered by a 9V-24VDC source via an RJ45 port
- LED indicator
- ID switch for unique ID setting
- Hardware reset button
- Board temperature measurement based on the MAX31725 I2C sensor

## Software Features
The BSP is designed as a support package for devices. Sample usage can be found in *bsp_test.c*

1. The application calls the BSPâ€™s ```init_bsp()```function to initialize interfaces and peripherals:
    - FT903 UART0 and USB console
    - rotary
    - LED
    - tempurature sensor
    - SD card device driver & FATFS filesystem library
    - FT811 EVE GPU device drivers 

2. By default, debug information is transmitted via USB because ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is set to one in *eclipse->properties->C/C++ General->Paths and Symbols->Symbols*
. However, if ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is se to 0, the debug information will be sent through UART0 instead. If the board is powered via RJ45 instead of USB, ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` must be set to 0.

3. To enable debug information in the eve_hal folder, set ```_DEBUG``` in *eclipse->properties->C/C++ General->Paths and Symbols->Symbols*

### Software requirement
This folder does not include the toolchain for FT903. For information on downloading, installing, and using the toolchain, please visit https://brtchip.com/ft9xx-toolchain/. This folder used toolchain setup can be found at https://brtchip.com/wp-content/uploads/Support/SoftwareExample/FT9xx/FT9xx_Toolchain_Setup_2.8.0_rc2.exe

### Build instruction
1. Install FT903 toolchain and download this folder

> [!CAUTION]
> If ```_DEBUG``` is defined, the print information will be sent for eve_hal.
> 
> If ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is defined to 1, the print information will be sent via USB; If ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` is defined to 0, it will be sent via UART0. If the board is powered via RJ45 instead of USB, ```ENABLE_USBDBG``` must be set to 0.

5. Build the project

6. The binary file will be in *[YOURPATH]\IDP-3500-04A\source\BSP\FT90x_Debug\BSP_IDP-3500-04A.bin*

7. Program the above binary onto the IDP-3500-04A development board (ensure the debug module is connected to the one-wire debug port as following).
