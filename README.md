## IDE support for GUI application development  

Bridgetek offers a comprehensive IDE tool, **EVE Screen Designer (ESD)**, to streamline GUI application development.  

Starting from **ESD 4.19.6**, the **IDP903-35PA** is supported as a native platform. You can download ESD from: [https://brtchip.com/esd/](https://brtchip.com/esd/).  

The default firmware is built from an example project within ESD.
